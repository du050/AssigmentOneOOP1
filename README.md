Stock Value Scenario
Princess Peach purchased some stock in Mario and Luigi’s Software, Inc. Here are the details of her purchase:
•	The number of shares purchased was 1500
•	Princess Peach paid 15.87 per share
•	Toad, the stockbroker, is paid a commission. 
o	A flat commission amount of 100.00 if the number of shares purchased is less than 1000.
o	No commission is to be paid if number of shares purchased is 1000 or more.
A month later, Princess Peach sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
•	The number of shares sold was 1500
•	Princess Peach sold the stock for 16.90 per share
•	Toad, the stockbroker, is paid a commission. 
o	A flat commission amount of 100.00 if the number of shares sold is less than 1000.
o	A flat commission amount of 50.00 if the number of shares sold is 1000 to 2000.
o	No commission is to be paid if number of shares sold is more than 2000.
Princess Peach would like a simple program to compute and display the following: 
•	The amount of money she paid for the stock.
•	The amount of commission she paid the broker when stock was bought.
•	The amount she sold the stock for.
•	The amount of commission she paid the broker when the stock was sold.
•	The amount of profit that she made after selling the stock and paying all the commissions. If she lost money in the transaction the amount of profit should be displayed as a negative number.
Equipment and Materials
For this assignment, you will need:
•	Python IDE
Instructions
This assignment consists of three sections, all completed outside of class time. See the Brightspace for exact due date.
1.	Working in group, review the stock value scenario and program testing section.
2.	Draft a flowchart to represent the process/algorithm of calculating a customer’s profit.
3.	Write a program that meets the requirements described in the above scenario.
4.	The program should ask the user to enter the following information:
•	Stock’s name
•	Total number of purchased shares and amount paid per share.
•	Total number of sold shares and amount paid per share.
5.	The input values should be validated as follows: 
•	Total number of purchased/sold shares must be a positive number (i.e., Not zero or negative).
•	Amount paid per a purchased/sold share must be positive amount (i.e., Not zero or negative).
•	Total number of sold shares should not exceed the total number of purchased shares.
6.	The program displays appropriate error message and exit the program if an input is invalid. Check test cases (5-9)
7.	The program calculates the cost of stock shares’ purchase, sales, and profit.
a.	Total purchase amount = number of purchased shares * amount paid per a purchased share.
b.	Total sale amount = number of sold shares * amount paid per a sold share.
c.	Profit = total sale amount - total purchase amount - purchase commission – sale commission
8.	The program displays purchase report, selling report, and profit. Check test cases (1-4).
9.	Constants MUST be used for commissions (0, 50, and 100) and threshold values of number of purchased/sold shares (1000, 2000).
10.	When your program is complete, use the data listed in each of the following tests below to see if your program works correctly.
Note:	Check your program against the marking criteria for the submission. 
11.	Your program’s output MUST EXACTLY MATCH the following tests.
12.	Submit the following to Brightspace:
•	The code of the program that you implemented (.py file)
•	A copy of the output from your test runs (.txt file)
•	The flow chart in PDF format.
•	The peer assessment in PDF format.
